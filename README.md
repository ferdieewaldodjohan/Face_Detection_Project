## Brief Explanation
1. First of all, user(s) have to register their faces. Run faceregister.py, and follow the instructions in code.
2. After user(s) register their faces user(s) have to augment their datasets. Run augmentasi.py to give greater varieties of datasets.
3. After user(s) augmented their datasets, run facerecognize.py to save the datasets of "known_faces" and "augmented_faces" to pkl file.
4. After all of these steps, user(s) are ready to use the facedetection.py code to try the recognition and detection program.
